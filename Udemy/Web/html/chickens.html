            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species
            such as the grey and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_junglefowl">Ceylon
                junglefowl<sup>[1]</sup></a>
            that are originally from Southeastern Asia.<br>Rooster or cock is a
            term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is
            a
            capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6]
            but
            the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
            subcontinent.<br>
            From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century
            BC.[7]
            Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day"
            having
            come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.

            </ul>
            Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[23]
